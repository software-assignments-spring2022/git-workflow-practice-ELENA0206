Link of interesting website: https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Software_Development_Engineer_(SDE)/Salary

This website estimates the salary of the jobs of software engineers and the demography of these jobs. For the entry level of this job's salary 
is 105k and the experience level is 140k but it would take up more than 20 years to reach this amount of salary. In this job area, over 80% of 
employees are male and only around 18% of people is female which is suprised me the most. There are many important skills you should know if you
want to become a soft engineer; however, the java, javascript and amazon web services are the top three popular skills people would like to know.
